WhatsApp Chat Analysis

Overview

This data science project aims to investigate the relationship between message length in WhatsApp groups and the time of day. The project is driven by the hypothesis that the time of day has a significant influence on the length of messages exchanged in WhatsApp groups.

Hypothesis
Hypothesis (H1): The message length in WhatsApp groups is influenced by the time of day.

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between the message length and the time of day in WhatsApp groups.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between the message length and the time of day in WhatsApp groups.

Variables
Independent Variable: Time of day
Dependent Variable: Message length
Data Collection

The dataset used for this analysis consists of my WhatsApp chat history, including timestamps and message lengths. Ensure that the data collected spans a representative period to capture various times of day and diverse conversation lengths.

Data Preprocessing

Before diving into analysis, perform the following preprocessing steps:

Timestamp Extraction: Extract timestamps from the raw data to identify the time each message was sent.
Message Length Calculation: Calculate the length of each message to serve as the dependent variable.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of message lengths across different times of the day. Visualization tools such as heat maps, scatter plots, or box plots can be employed to illustrate patterns and trends.

Statistical Analysis

Apply statistical methods like regression analysis and p-value to test the hypothesis.

Results

There is no finding that shows there is a link between time of the day and message lenght according to y WhatsApp chat history.

Dependencies

Python, and libraries' such as mathplotlib, pandas, seaborn.
